# Changelog
#------------------------------
- Adjusted FP regeneration:

 - Base Gain is 2
 - Enchanted is 2
 - Clarity is 2
 - Pulsating is 2

 - Attunment Mastery is 3

- Adjusted spell/item FP costs to account for the FP change.
- Curses no longer grant additional soul absorption.

- Hunter's Pistol is now purely a parrying tool. It no longer emits a bullet, and thus will more reliably causes parries. But it no longer deals any damage.
 - Adjusted the force parry window to make the pistol easier to parry with.
- Removed the parry frames from the other sidearms.
- Boosted the base damage of the other pistol sidearms, as they are now intended for damage.
- Reduced the stamina cost of the pistol/spray sidearms.
- Reduced the cancel window for the 'cannot fire' animations for the pistols.

- Added weapon jam mechanic to the pistol/spray sidearms:
 - There is now a base chance to play the 'cannot fire' animation each time the pistol is used.
  - Hunter's Pistol: 5%
  - Repeating Pistol: 10%
  - Evelynn: 5%
  - Blunderbuss: 20%
  - Rosamarinus: 10%
 - Rapid attacks will boost the jam chance, stacking up to 5 times. Each stack decays after 5 seconds.
  - Shot 1: +5%
  - Shot 2: +5%
  - Shot 3: +5%
  - Shot 4: +5%
  - Shot 5: +5%
 - After a jam, there is a grace period of 4 seconds where you cannot get another jam.
 - The first shot (if you have not shot for 30 seconds or more) will never jam.
