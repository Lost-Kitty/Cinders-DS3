 - Attunment Mastery is 3

- Adjusted spell/item FP costs to account for the FP change.
- Curses no longer grant additional soul absorption.

- Hunter's Pistol is now purely a parrying tool. It no longer emits a bullet, and thus will more reliably cause parries. However it no longer deals any damage.
 - Adjusted the force parry window to make the pistol easier to parry with.
- Removed the parry frames from the other sidearms.
- Boosted the base damage of the other pistol sidearms, as they are now intended for damage.
- Reduced the stamina cost of the pistol/spray sidearms.
- Reduced the cancel window for the 'cannot fire' animations for the pistols.

- Added weapon jam mechanic to the pistol/spray sidearms:

  - Hunter's Pistol: 5%
  - Repeating Pistol: 10%
  - Evelynn: 5%
  - Blunderbuss: 20%
  - Rosamarinus: 25%

  - Shot 1: +5%
  - Shot 2: +5%
  - Shot 3: +5%
  - Shot 4: +5%
  - Shot 5: +5%
 - After a jam, there is a grace period of 4 seconds where you cannot get another jam.
 - The first shot (if you have not shot for 30 seconds or more) will never jam.
 
- Changed the poise system:
 - Removed the DS3 'toughness' system.
 - Implemented a custom system within the HKS that emulates the feel of DS1 poise.
 - Chest Armor provides stagger resistance. (Heavy to Medium only)
 - Wolf Ring now provides its own stagger resistance. This stack with the other stagger resistances.
 - Weapons that boosted poise now provide their own stagger resistance. This stack with the other stagger resistances.
 - Spells that boosted poise now provide their own stagger resistance. This stack with the other stagger resistances.
 - Items that boosted poise now provide their own stagger resistance. This stack with the other stagger resistances.

- Bosses:
 - Sister Friede poise reduced to 0.
